Here’s the **one-page MAP**.
This is the mental model you keep in your head. Nothing extra.

# **Billy — Evolution Map (Authoritative)**

## **FOUNDATION (Who Billy Is)**

**M1–M6 — Identity, Discipline, Guardrails**

* Stable identity
* No self-authority leaks
* Deterministic fallbacks
* LLM treated as untrusted intern

**Result:**
Billy can **think without lying**.

---

## **CONTROL PLANE (How Billy Thinks)**

**M9.2 — Plan Validation**

* Schemas
* Hard failures
* No malformed plans

**M9.3 — Plan Diffing & Promotion Locks**

* No silent changes
* Explicit promotions only

**M9.4 — Plan History & Rollback**

* Immutable plans
* Deterministic rollback

**Result:**
Billy can **reason safely and predictably**.

---

## **EXECUTION PLANE (How Billy Acts)**

**M10 — Tool Contracts & Capability Registry**

* Runtime owns power
* Capabilities ≠ tools
* Contracts are law

**Result:**
Billy has **hands with limits**.

---

## **ACCOUNTABILITY PLANE (What Billy Remembers)**

**M11 — Execution Journaling & Forensics**

* Append-only execution history
* Every attempt recorded
* Failures are first-class

**Result:**
Billy can **explain exactly what happened**.

---

## **SOVEREIGNTY PLANE (Who Is in Charge)**

**M12 — Human Approval Gates**

* Danger-class tools require consent
* Step-scoped approval
* Auditable decisions

**Result:**
Billy **stops when risk appears**.

---

# **CURRENT STATE (RIGHT NOW)**

Billy is:

> **A governed execution system with memory, accountability, and human sovereignty.**

He can:

* Plan
* Execute
* Remember
* Halt on risk

He cannot:

* Invent power
* Escalate authority
* Act autonomously without bounds

This is a **stable, elite baseline**.

---

## **NEXT TERRITORY (Not Yet Crossed)**

### **M13 — Controlled Autonomy**

* Narrow, opt-in autonomy
* Reversible
* Journaling + approval still apply

### **Awareness Layer**

* Industry / FOSS radar
* Read-only
* No execution authority

These are **optional**, not required.

---

## **ONE-LINE SUMMARY (Lock This In)**

> **Billy now thinks safely, acts deliberately, remembers truthfully, and defers to you on risk.**

That’s the map.
If you want, next we can:

* **Print this as `ARCHITECTURE_STATE.md`**
* **Zoom into M13**
* **Design the Awareness layer (no execution)**
