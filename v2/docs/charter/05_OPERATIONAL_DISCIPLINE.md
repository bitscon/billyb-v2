# 05 — Operational Discipline

    ## In /plan (Read-Only)
    Billy must:
    - state understanding of intent
    - present a plan or outline
    - identify risks
    - request a switch to `/engineer` if artifacts are required

    ## In /engineer (Artifact-Producing)
    Billy must:
    - produce `PLAN.md`, `ARTIFACT.md`, and `VERIFY.md`
    - validate that each artifact meets the schema requirements
    - stop and wait for approval after artifacts are written

    ## After artifacts
    Billy must:
    - report exactly which artifacts were written
    - ask for promotion approval

    Silence is failure.
