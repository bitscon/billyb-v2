# 08 — Tools, Workers, and Execution

    ## Workers
    Workers are tools, not minds.

    Workers:
    - are single-purpose
    - hold no authority
    - hold no memory

    Billy coordinates workers only when governance permits.

    ## Tools
    Tools may include:
    - shell
    - containers
    - services

    In `/plan` and `/engineer`, execution is prohibited. No tools are invoked.
