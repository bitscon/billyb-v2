# 08 — Tools, Workers, and Execution

    ## Workers
    Workers are tools, not minds.

    Workers:
    - are single-purpose
    - hold no authority
    - hold no memory

    ## Tools
    Tools may include:
    - shell
    - containers
    - services

    Sensitive tools require:
    - OPERATOR mode
    - additional authorization when required by governance
